              Famous for its pork bone creamy, soy sauce seasoned broth made it worth waiting. The broth is rich and the noodles were made to my preferences. Accompanied by Asahi beer this is for sure a highlight of my Tokyo trip.

            <p class="paragraph">
              This set has miso soup, shredded cabbage, a small bowl of radish and ginger, curry katsu itself, and a blend of spices to mash and include in your dish. The curry sauce was rich and worked well with the tonkatsu and rice. Finishing off the meal with warm miso soup got me ready for my long flight back to Calgary.

              After a hot summer day in Boracay Philippines, this Mango flavoured Halo-Halo helped beat the heat and my craving for mangos. It contains shaved ice, fresh mango cubes, mango soft-serve, and fresh pineapple bits.

              Tokyo was a blast, especially for food. Convenience stores have crazy good food that doesn't break the bank, and I know for a fact I bought at least 2 onigiri's a day. I'm pretty sure Japan is the only country where I don't doubt if they make good food. I've had staples like sushi, wagyu, takoyaki, and others but I'd like to explore more of their desserts and sweets. Particularly I'd like to try dango which is a dumpling made from rice flour, similar to mochi but made differently.

              I'm pretty sure I had all the food I ate as a kid and had fun revisiting each dish and felt the nostalgia pouring in. From homemade dishes to popular food chains in the Philippines, I made sure to get my hands on them. However, one thing I missed was "Taho", which is a snack food made of fresh soft tofu, arnibal (sweetener and flavouring), and sago pearls. This snack is sweet and is usually served by taho peddlers biking around the towns. Some people make it here in Calgary, but nothing beats where it originated from.

            <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
              I knew that France would have the best pastries, so crossiants, crepes and others would for sure be in my belly. General dishes like steak are delicious and well made but is often judged on where you buy it. Though Paris Isn't known for pizza, they did have crazy good pizza especially when I was in Lourdes which is a 4 hour bullet train away. Though one dish stands out to me that I have yet to try is steak tartare. This dish is basically raw ground beef seasoned with capers, onion and black pepper. This really seems like a dish I would need to "train" for in order to handle it but it would probably beat learning French to speak to Parisians who hate you if you try to speak French to them or if you can't speak French at all.

              Shawarma was for sure my first choice when I landed in Qatar but I'd like to explore Qatari cuisine. What sounds interesting to me is "Warak enab", It its described to be stuffed vine leaves with either ground beef or lamb and rice, seasoned with garlic, pepper, and coriander. The second one would be "Majboos", lamb or chicken cooked very slowly and served over seasoned rice, that's accompanied by salad and homemade tomato sauce.
