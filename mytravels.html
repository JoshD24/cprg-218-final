        <p>
         Here I have my favourite photos and where I took them! Like here for example, this was taken in Ikebukuro and the main highlight for me is Godzilla looking over a building. I have a soft spot for Monster flicks and Godzilla has to be my favourite one.

             I managed to catch a candid shot of my mom walking through the white sands of Boracay. Initially, the focal point was the view and the Philippine flag but my mom walking by made it the candid shot of the summer

              This was my second time seeing the Peppers for their Unlimited Love tour and it was electrifying! They played one of my favourite song "Wet Sand", while playing other classics and songs from their new album. I'll keep watching them live till I'm broke.

              Called my brother over, and I managed to snap a photo of him holding the Eiffel Tower. Neat little photo playing around with perspectives and yeah this was the first try too, not to brag or anything.

            <p>I live in Cochrane, Alberta! "How the West is Now", is around a 25 minute drive if you don't follow the speed limit. Known for McKay's ice cream, a perfect stop going or coming from Banff.</p>
